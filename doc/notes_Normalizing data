Normalizing data 
Normalizing data + margins 


fluctuations
	- maybe small freq fluctuations are noise
	1-> sliding window /moving avg to have the same num of points
	2-> new data -> different configs -> if in one config there's not so many noise -> mark it


evaluation as regr model
	-> mse, rmse


evaluation as classification also
	-> take t1  and t1+delta -> up? down? -> 2 classes -> accuracy evaluation
